			<h1>Reflection</h1>
			<section>
				This subject has really allowed me to have fun; experiment with new technology
				and also have the opportunity to write JavaScript in an application's setting.
				I really enjoyed the time I spent programming, and the time I spent solving the
				shere volume of problems that Trove threw at me.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The Design</h2>
				<section>
					We chose groups quite early on in the semester, which is always wise in my opinion. Early
					on I had my heart set on doing an
					<a href='http://aussiemon.info/#/' target='blank'>AuzzieMon</a> clone but unfortunately
					that idea got shot down in a hail of fire. So we changed tack and went with the timeline
					idea.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Which hat is mine?</h3>
					Once we had an idea chosen; we were then tasked with 'wearing' each of the 6 coloured
					hats from Edward de Bono. I am really good at being a white and a black hat. I think
					it's because I approach a problem from a very logical, programming perspective.
					<br />
					Unfortunately I have great trouble seperating myself from the implementation phase of
					any project.
					During the design phase, I frequently shot down ideas(in my head) that I considered too
					hard to implement. I had this problem in DECO2500 as well where I would shoot down
					ideas(also internally) which were unfeasable to implement. I think it comes from my
					programming background; always focusing on if a problem is solveable, and not on the UX
					of that idea.

				<h2>The Build</h2>
				<section>
					I was designated lead programmer and got stuck into making the application tick.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>False Start</h3>
					With JavaScript and CSS comming back into fashion as web browsers become more forward
					thinking and standards compliant(IE *shakes fist*) this project seemed perfect to use the
					newer compile-to languages like
					<a href="libs-and-langs.html#coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and
					<a href="libs-and-langs.html#SCSS">SCSS</a>. So I set my heart on using them.
					Unfortunately I overlooked the fact that I wasn't working alone. This caused problems
					because my group would edit the compiled JavaScript, then I would edit the CoffeeScript
					and when it compiled, the JavaScript changes would be overwritten. This meant that I
					changed everything back to plain CSS and JavaScript.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>A slightly better start</h3>
					Unfortunately when I moved over to JavaScript, I kept the singleton class style that I
					had written in CoffeeScript(where it's clearer). This made the code really hard to read
					and then throw in JavaScript's scoping for even more debugging fun.
					<br />
					What I realise now is that having the singleton pattern is really bad practice in the
					circumstances that I used them. It made the code harder to understand, develop and debug.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Slowly does it</h3>
					After finally managing to get the timetable to display; I finally started loading LOTS of
					data. Which lead to another problem. Speed. Every time new data needed to be added; lots
					of data changed, the massive DOM was rearanged frequently. This made the page
					simply freeze every time new data was added. Obviously this was unacceptable, so we solved
					it by limiting the amount of data loaded. A stop gap solution obviously.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Where Have You Been</h3>
					And then <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a> found its way
					into my Google searches. It is the answer I had been looking for. This made all the code
					that I had written to organise the timeline redundant; but it made the timeline
					responsive(slightly usable on mobile), fast and look better.
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The Reflection</h2>
				<section>
					Well this is a little bit meta, but here we go. This site was an absolute pain to put
					together at first. The most important question flowing through my mind was: <i>How am I
						going to make it look decent?
					</i>. I started out with my go-to design. Floating header,
					fixed footer, and grey; The more grey the better, Use all the greys. But that really
					didn't feel right to me. It felt too 'Bootstrappy'.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Material to the Rescue</h3>
					So I decided I'd go with another
					option. After reading a couple of groups final reports for DECO3801, I noticed that
					they had used Google's
					<a href='http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html'
					target='_blank'>Material Design</a>; so I borrowed most of the guidelines.
					Single primary color; and other colors derrived from it. This really helped me get over
					the 'blank canvas syndrome' and get on with actually creating content for the site.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Language Choice<a href='libs-and-langs.html' target='_blank' class='link-icon'></a>
					</h3>
					This was my own project; no-one else needed to look at it; so I decided to use SCSS. It
					has made life so easy. The number of times I've needed to change the padding on the
					footer; and it has just flowed through. Plus I think it makes the style sheets easier to
					read and manage
				</section>

				<h2>Overall</h2>
				<section>
					I really enjoyed the course. My group was fantastic, doing the reports and 'fluffy' stuff
					whilst I worked on the website. I came into this course treating it as a 'easy 7'
					subject; but I think the work level was sufficient.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Teaching</h3>
					I didn't go to any of the lectures after the first few. The slides were consise
					and clear giving me the information I needed without having to sit through it. Lots
					of the lecture's content just didn't apply to me due to my experiences on projects
					both inside and outside university.
					<br />
					I really didn't find the workshops usefull at all. I guess this was because I am
					proficient in all the neccessary languages and I also wasn't doing any of the extra
					stuff around the website such as the poster.
					<br />
					I did however appreciate the contact times as a time to work on the project whilst
					also having the group there to bounce ideas off.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Blogging<a href='http://lee-symes-deco1800.blogspot.com.au/'
						target='_blank' class='link-icon'></a>
					</h3>
					I did like the requirement to write a blog. I tended to write really short posts where
					I just wanted to do the 'assigned' post; and really long essays when I was given free
					reign. I also found that I have a distinct preference to write very informally(also on
					this site). It's possibly my personality to use humor to make myself feel at ease.
