			<h1>Reflection</h1>
			<section>
				This subject has really allowed me to have fun; experiment with new technology
				and also have the opportunity to write JavaScript in an application's setting.
				I really enjoyed the time I spent programming, and the time I spent solving the
				shere volume of problems that Trove threw at me.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>The Early Weeks</h2>
				So early on; I had my heart set on doing <a
				href='http://aussiemon.info/#/' target='blank'>AuzzieMon</a> but unfortunately that idea got
				shot down in a hail of fire. So we changed tack and went with the timeline idea. In
				keeping with my background from programming, my main concerns were purely with
				implementation; how was the timeline going to be build(it was hard work).<br />
				So I set my heart on using <a href="libs-and-langs.html#coffeescript">CoffeeScript</a> and
				<a href="libs-and-langs.html#SCSS">SCSS</a>. I think it would have been really good to do;
				however the technical knowledge of the rest of my group wasn't enough to warrant it;
				so back to the basics of JavaScript and CSS.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>To coding</h2>
				I was designated lead programmer and got stuck into making the application tick.
				Unfortunately I decided to make singletons by creating a class and then creating a new
				instance and returning it.  For example:
				<div class='code-sample' language='javascript' src='samples/singleton.js'>
				</div>
				Unfortunately this is really bad practice mainly because it is completely unnecessary.
				It makes the code hard to read whilst providing no benefits.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Slowly does it</h2>
				After finally managing to get the timetable to display; I finally started loading LOTS of
				data. Which lead to another problem. Speed. Every time new data needed to be added; lots
				of data changed, the massive DOM was rearanged frequently. This made the page
				simply freeze every time new data was added. Obviously this was unacceptable, so we solved
				it by limiting the amount of data loaded. A stop gap solution obviously.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Where Have You Been</h2>
				And then <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank">Masonry</a> found its way
				into my Google searches. It is the answer I had been looking for. This made all the code
				that I had written to organise the timeline redundant; but it made the timeline
				responsive(slightly usable on mobile), fast and look better.
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Overall</h2>
				I really enjoyed the course; My personal experience of it was that it was incredibly easy.
				The content was presented in a way that I could absorb in my own time which helped
				significantly.
				<br />
				I think that my ability to work with a team of people improved significantly; designating
				small tasks out to the team meant that I could focus on the large components, and also
				allow them to partake in the development as well.
